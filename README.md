# item-ws (REST Web Sevice)
This is an example of a simple REST Web Service written in Java.  

I have put this project here mainly for a code sample, but if you would like to use it for reference or a starting point, please be my guest (MIT license applied of course).

The project is a Maven project.  I deploy the WAR in Tomcat 7, and I have MySQL running for the DB.  I simply run the unit tests in eclipse, but setting up the maven project on a CI server would be straight forward.

I also tested using the ARC App installed in Chrome (nice testing tool for REST services).

My next project will be an AngularJS project that uses item-ws for a data source.  An authentication/authorization layer will be added to the service at that point.
